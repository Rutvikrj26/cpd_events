# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical and legacy documentation that is no longer current but preserved for reference.

## Purpose

Documentation is archived when:
- It has been superseded by newer documentation
- It describes features or approaches that are no longer used
- It has historical value but is not relevant to current development
- It provides context for past decisions

## Directory Structure

```
.archive/
└── legacy/          # Pre-reorganization documentation
```

## Legacy Documentation

The `legacy/` subdirectory contains documentation from before the January 2026 documentation reorganization. This includes:

- Old billing system documentation
- Previous frontend screen architectures
- Superseded implementation plans
- Historical workflow documentation
- Previous pricing implementations

## Using Archived Documentation

### When to Reference
- Understanding historical context for decisions
- Researching why certain approaches were changed
- Learning from past implementations
- Auditing system evolution

### When NOT to Reference
- Building new features (use current docs)
- Onboarding new developers (use current docs)
- Understanding current system behavior (use current docs)

## Important Notice

**This documentation is NOT current and should not be used for:**
- Development guidance
- System understanding
- Feature implementation
- API specifications

**Always refer to current documentation in the main docs/ directory and component READMEs.**

## Current Documentation

For current, up-to-date documentation, see:
- [Documentation Index](../INDEX.md)
- [Backend README](../../backend/README.md)
- [Frontend README](../../frontend/README.md)
- [Main README](../../README.md)

## Maintenance

### Retention Policy
Archived documentation is retained indefinitely for historical reference unless:
- It contains sensitive information
- It has zero historical value
- It's completely duplicated elsewhere

### Organization
Keep archived docs organized by:
- Date (when archived)
- Category (what it documents)
- Clear naming (what it is)
